# CentIA
 
**CentIA** is an interactive chatbot,
The name CentIA is divided into two parts:  
- **Cent**: referring to Centrale.  
- **IA** : representing Artificial Intelligence.  


This chatbot is part of **my learning journey** in AI development. It combines NLP techniques to create dynamic interactions

## Features
The chatbot uses an `intents.json` file as input, where you can customize and enhance interactions by adding your own  patterns, and responses.

### Main Structure
1. **`training.py`**: This file is used to train the chatbot model based on a neural network. It generates the necessary files for the chatbot to function.
2. **`app.py`**: This file allows you to interact with the chatbot after training.

### How to Use CentIA?
1. Modify the `intents.json` file if you want to personalize prompts or responses.  
2. Run the **`training.py`** script to train the model:  

       ```python training.py````
Then launch app.py to start chatting with the chatbot
  ```bash python app.py    ```
